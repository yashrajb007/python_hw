'''----------------------------- What Is Docstring?  ----------------------------------

    Docstring is a short form of documentation string. Its purpose is to give the programmer
a brief knowledge about the functionality of the function. It must be the first string in
a function, and it is also an optional string but always good to have it while working on
programs having multiple functions. The syntax for writing a docstring is very simple as it
is just a string written in between three double quotes placed three times (""" """) on either
side of the string. But it has to be the first line of code in the functionâ€™s body. 
To call a docstring we write the name of the function followed by ._doc_.'''
